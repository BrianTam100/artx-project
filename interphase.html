    <h1>Interphase - Phases Breakdown</h1>
    <p>Background information about the three phases in Interphase.</p>

    <div id="g1">
        <h2>G1 Phase: Cell Growth</h2>
        <p>During the G1 phase, the cell grows in size, produces RNA and proteins, and prepares for DNA replication. This phase prepares the cell for DNA replication in the S phase.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="s-phase">
        <h2>S Phase: DNA Replication</h2>
        <p>In the S phase, the cell replicates its DNA, making an exact copy of its entire genome, ensuring that both daughter cells have the same genetic mateiral
        <p><strong>Key Activity:</strong> The entire genome is copied during this phase, preparing for accurate chromosome separation in the next stage of cell division.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="g2-phase">
        <h2>G2 Phase: Preparing for Mitosis</h2>
        <p>In the G2 phase, the cell continues to grow and synthesizes more proteins and organelles. This phase ensures that the cell is fully prepared to enter mitosis, with all the necessary components for cell division.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Activity:</strong> The cell checks for DNA errors and ensures all required proteins and organelles are ready for mitosis.</p>
