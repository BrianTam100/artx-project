    <h1>Anaphase - Cell Division Process</h1>

    <section>
        <p>During <strong>Anaphase</strong>, the sister chromatids of each chromosome are separated and pulled toward opposite poles of the cell. This ensures that each daughter cell will receive a complete set of chromosomes. The separation is facilitated by microtubules that attach to the kinetochores of each chromatid and pull them apart.</p>

        <h2>Possible complications during anaphase: Nondisjunction and Aneuploidy</h2>
        <p><strong>Nondisjunction</strong> is the failure of chromosomes or chromatids to separate properly during cell division. When this occurs, it results in daughter cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes, leading to a condition known as <strong>aneuploidy</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Types of Aneuploidy</h3>
        <p>Aneuploidy can result in the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monosomy</strong> (n-1): One chromosome is missing. Example: <strong>Turner Syndrome</strong> (45, X).</li>
            <li><strong>Trisomy</strong> (n+1): An extra chromosome is present. Example: <strong>Down Syndrome</strong> (Trisomy 21).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nondisjunction</h3>
        <p>Meiotic nondisjunction, which occurs during the formation of gametes, can lead to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Down Syndrome</strong> (Trisomy 21): This results in an intellectual disability and increased risk of certain health conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Patau Syndrome</strong> (Trisomy 13): Associated with severe developmental and physical abnormalities, with a life expectancy typically less than one year.</li>
            <li><strong>Edwards Syndrome</strong> (Trisomy 18): Associated with severe intellectual disabilities, heart defects, and early mortality.</li>
        </ul>
