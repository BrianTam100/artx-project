        <h2>What Happens During Telophase?</h2>
        <p>Telophase is the final stage of mitosis. This stage involves the following key events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The chromosomes, which were previously condensed, turn back into chromatin.</li>
            <li>New nuclear envelopes form around each set of chromosomes, creating two distinct nuclei in the cell.</li>
            <li>The spindle fibers dissolve as the cell prepares for cytokinesis, where the cell splits into two identical daughter cells.</li>
        </ul>
